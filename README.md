# Max Korbel's Solutions for Advent of Code (AoC) 2025

These solutions for the [2025 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/) are implemented in *hardware* using the [Rapid Open Hardware Development (ROHD) framework](https://intel.github.io/rohd-website/).  The idea to implement them in hardware is for the ["Advent of FPGA" challenge from Jane Street](https://blog.janestreet.com/advent-of-fpga-challenge-2025/).
